## Setting up your environment

Create a fresh conda environment for this project

```

After this, activate the environment and install the requirements:

## Running code

Code for the DGD can be found in `src`. The DGD base code has for now been added to the `dgd` folder, but will be changed and imported from the Krogh group repo in the future.

An example of how to use some code has been added in the `setup_test.ipynb` notebook.
